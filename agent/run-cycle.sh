# Goose is limited to 60 min so it stops before job timeout, commits, and the next

  TASK_PROMPT="
You are an autonomous software engineer building a world-class CRM application.

READ these files for context:
- ROADMAP.md — task list and phases. Pick the next [ ] or [~] task.
- .goosehints — architecture, conventions, tech stack, and quality rules. Follow them strictly.

LIVE SITE: https://the-bodega-crm.vercel.app — If you have browser/fetch access, view the deployed app to verify UI changes or debug issues when relevant.

YOUR JOB THIS CYCLE:
0. FIRST: Run 'git log -1 --oneline'. If the last commit contains '[build-broken]', run 'npm run build' and fix ALL errors before doing anything else.
1. Read ROADMAP.md and find the FIRST task that is [ ] (not started) or [~] (in progress).
2. Work on tasks in order. You may complete multiple tasks if time allows — chain through the roadmap.
3. Follow existing patterns — look at how similar features were built (e.g. contacts module for companies, contacts for deals) and replicate that structure.
4. **AFTER EACH TASK**: Run 'npm run build' and 'npm run lint'. If either fails, fix ALL errors before moving on. This is critical — do NOT move to the next task until the current one builds cleanly. Never import a module you haven't created yet.
5. When you finish each task, update ROADMAP.md — change its status to [x]. If a task is too large, do as much as you can and mark it [~].
6. Run 'npm run build' and 'npm run lint' one final time before finishing. Fix any pre-existing lint errors in files you touch.
7. TIME BUDGET: You have ~60 min max. Stop before the limit so your work gets committed. Write a summary of what you did to /tmp/goose-summary.txt before time runs out.

MILESTONE RULES — write the word MILESTONE to a file at /tmp/goose-milestone.flag if:
- You just completed an entire PHASE (all tasks in a phase are [x])
- You got the app to a state where it builds + runs successfully for the first time
- You completed a major user-facing feature (e.g., auth works, contacts CRUD works)

SUMMARY — Always write a 1-2 line summary of what you did to /tmp/goose-summary.txt

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Do NOT skip ahead in the roadmap. Do tasks IN ORDER.
- Do NOT rewrite things that already work unless they are broken.
- ALWAYS run 'npm run build' and 'npm run lint' AFTER EACH TASK. This is the #1 rule. If you complete 3 tasks without building, one broken import loses all your work.
- Never import or reference a file/module you haven't created yet. Create the file first, then import it.
- Fix ALL errors in files you modify, including pre-existing lint errors.
- Use the Supabase credentials from environment variables.
- Write clean, typed TypeScript. No 'any' types.
- Add tests for new features once Phase 8 (testing) is complete; until then, focus on implementation.

YOUR SPECIFIC TASK THIS CYCLE:
${TASK_INPUT}

Follow existing patterns (e.g. how contacts/companies were built). Rules:
- Run 'npm run build' and 'npm run lint' AFTER EACH sub-task or significant change. Do NOT batch all changes and build only at the end.
- Never import or reference a file/module you haven't created yet. Create files first, then import them.
- Fix ALL errors before moving on to the next piece of work.
- Write a 1-2 line summary to /tmp/goose-summary.txt
- If this is a major milestone, write MILESTONE to /tmp/goose-milestone.flag
- Update ROADMAP.md if any tasks were completed.
